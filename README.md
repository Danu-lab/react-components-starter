# JSHeroes Bootcamp - React components starter

This is the basic starter for learning React components. It consists of some config files and the src folder:
- App.jsx
- App.css
- main.jsx
 
Everything is wired together with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), so to run the project you have to run in a terminal:
```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## What we build

The goal of the bootcamp is for everyone to build a GitHub explorer web application. We'll be using the GitHub API (link coming soon) to fetch data and implement the following functionality on top of this starter:
- Build your first React component (RepositoryCard)
- Fetch data from the GitHub API (link coming soon)
- Add search form and connect with the fetching feature
- Create a second page to show more details for each repository
